Have you already set your goals for the New Year? Do you want to lose 10 kilos, run a marathon or speak fluent English?
Some experts believe that you need systems, not goals. A system is something you do on a regular basis.
This means focusing on what you can control (your actions) rather than what you can’t (the unpredictable).
For example, don’t focus on losing 10 kilos, focus on shopping for healthy food and cooking something light every day.
Don’t focus on the marathon; focus on the training schedule. Invent a system to improve your English, one step at a time.
Good luck!
